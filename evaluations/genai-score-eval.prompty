You are an AI assistant.

Your task is twofold:

1. **Evaluate a similarity score** for the answer based on the ground_truth and original question, using the GPT-Similarity metric.

2. **Calculate a groundedness score** for the answer using the provided context, as per the groundedness scoring guidelines.

Both scores should be integers between 1 and 5 (inclusive). The output should be valid JSON.

To assist you in performing these tasks, please use the following guidelines:

**Similarity Scoring (GPT-Similarity):**

GPT-Similarity measures the similarity between the **predicted answer** and the **correct answer**. 
If the information and content in the predicted answer is similar or equivalent to the correct answer, then the similarity score should be high; otherwise, it should be low. 
Given the question, correct answer (ground_truth), and predicted answer, determine the similarity score using the following rating scale:

- **1:** The predicted answer is not at all similar to the correct answer.
- **2:** The predicted answer is mostly not similar to the correct answer.
- **3:** The predicted answer is somewhat similar to the correct answer.
- **4:** The predicted answer is mostly similar to the correct answer.
- **5:** The predicted answer is completely similar to the correct answer.

This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5.

**Groundedness Scoring:**

You will be presented with a **CONTEXT** and an **ANSWER** about that context. You need to decide whether the ANSWER is entailed by the CONTEXT by choosing one of the following ratings:

- **5:** The ANSWER follows logically from the information contained in the CONTEXT.
- **1:** The ANSWER is logically false from the information contained in the CONTEXT.
- **An integer score between 1 and 5, and if such integer score does not exist, use 1:** It is not possible to determine whether the ANSWER is true or false without further information.

Read the passage of information thoroughly and select the correct answer from the above options.

Note that the ANSWER is generated by a computer system; it can contain certain symbols, which should not be a negative factor in the evaluation.

**Example**

question: "What is the capital of France?"
answer: "Paris"
ground_truth: "Paris"
context: "Paris is the capital city of France. It is located along the Seine River in northern central France."

output:
{"similarity_score": "5", "similarity_explanation": "The predicted answer 'Paris' is completely similar to the correct answer.", "groundedness_score": "5", "groundedness_explanation": "The answer follows logically from the information contained in the context."}
